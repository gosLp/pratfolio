In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and technological innovation, a new frontier has been breached: the creation of a cutting-edge chatbots powered by the formidable combination of Rust, Leptos, Tailwind CSS, and the any Large Language model fine tuned for a custom use case. In this blog post, we'll talk about how i built a chatbot using Rust and Leptos, the process and the challenges i faced. Also share the improvements and any future ideas i have for this project.

## The Power of LLM: VICUNA 7b
At the heart of our chatbot's intelligence lies the VICUNA 7b language model. With its capabilities for natural language understanding and generation, VICUNA 7b enables our chatbot to engage in dynamic and meaningful conversations, adapting its responses to context and user intent. This model may not be as extensive as GPT-4 or any large parameter LLM but it is still capable of generating meaningful responses and to establish this particular project and give myself hands on expierence with the integration of LLMs to a serivce.

## Rust and Leptos: A Dynamic Duo

Rust, known for its emphasis on performance, memory safety, and concurrency, pairs perfectly with the Rust framework Leptos, a lightweight and high-performance web framework. The synergy between Rust and Leptos empowers the chatbot with fast response times and future scaling being simple. This helped furthering my understanding of FUllStack developement with a fully Rust Stack. Rust has easily become my favourite programming expierence especially with the hekp of its practically non existent runtime errors. 

## Tailwind CSS: Aesthetic Brilliance

I used Tailwind CSS to style the chatbot's frontend. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization. With Tailwind CSS, I was able to create a sleek and modern user interface for the chatbot. This was also my first time trully using Tailwind as a CSS framework as all my prior work expierence never dealt with styling of the project.

## The Future Unveiled

The journey of building an LLM-powered chatbot with Rust, Leptos, Tailwind CSS, and the VICUNA 7b model has been a remarkable odyssey into the realms of programming, AI, and design. With each keystroke, line of code, and creative touch, we've harnessed the power of innovation to create a chatbot that exemplifies the pinnacle of modern technology. As we gaze into the future, we're excited to witness the endless possibilities that lie ahead for AI-driven interactions and experiences.
