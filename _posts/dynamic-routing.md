In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and technological innovation, a new frontier has been breached: the creation of a cutting-edge chatbots powered by the formidable combination of Rust, Leptos, Tailwind CSS, and the any Large Language model fine tuned for a custom use case. In this blog post, we'll talk about how i built a chatbot using Rust and Leptos, the process and the challenges i faced. Also share the improvements and any future ideas i have for this project.

## The Power of LLM: VICUNA 7b
At the heart of our chatbot's intelligence lies the VICUNA 7b language model. With its capabilities for natural language understanding and generation, VICUNA 7b enables our chatbot to engage in dynamic and meaningful conversations, adapting its responses to context and user intent. This model may not be as extensive as GPT-4 or any large parameter LLM but it is still capable of generating meaningful responses and to establish this particular project and give myself hands on expierence with the integration of LLMs to a serivce.

## Rust and Leptos: A Dynamic Duo

Rust, known for its emphasis on performance, memory safety, and concurrency, pairs perfectly with Leptos, a lightweight and high-performance web framework. The synergy between Rust and Leptos empowers our chatbot with lightning-fast response times and robust capabilities, ensuring seamless interactions with users. The integration of these technologies showcases the prowess of modern programming in crafting an efficient and reliable chatbot architecture.
